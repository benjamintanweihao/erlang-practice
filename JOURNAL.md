* Picked up a copy of "Programming Erlang, Second Edition" and browsed 
through it a bit.
* Added some checklists to CHECKLISTS.md

## December 27, 2013

* Worked through the first two chapters of "Programming Erlang", typing in the
code examples as I went.

* Knocked several items off of the preliminaries checklist, many of which were
directly explained in CH2 of the book.

* Added new items to preliminaries checklist and made it a bit finer grained.

* Remembered the weird comma, semicolon, period syntax in Erlang, but still
don't know what each is used for. (Will need to learn that)
